# First Ethernet Cable Build (Cat6, T568B)

**Date:** 2025-09-12  
**Category:** Physical Layer / Cabling  
**Tools Used:** Cat6 bulk cable, RJ45 connectors, crimping tool, cable tester

## What I Built
I built my first Ethernet cable using the T568B standard for a straight-through connection.

## What Went Wrong (and Why That’s OK)
My first attempt failed testing because one connector was crimped in reverse orientation.
This caused pins to map incorrectly (1→8, 2→7).

## What I Learned
- Orientation matters when terminating RJ45 connectors
- Straight-through cables require the same pinout on both ends
- Testing cables is essential before deployment
- Physical-layer work builds confidence through repetition

## Why This Matters
This was my first hands-on networking task.
Instead of only reading about cabling, I physically built, tested, failed, and corrected a real Ethernet cable.
