# Networking Journey

This repository documents my hands-on learning as I transition into Network Engineering and CyberOps.

I’m focusing on:
- Core networking fundamentals (Ethernet, switching, routing)
- Physical cabling and hardware
- Home lab builds
- Packet Tracer labs
- Automation and Raspberry Pi projects (future)

## Why this repo exists
I’m intentionally documenting what I *build and learn*, not just what I study.
This is a living log of practical skills and lessons learned.
